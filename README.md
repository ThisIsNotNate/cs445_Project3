# GravRunner

Jump and invert gravity in this infinite runner pixel-art inspired game. The GravRunner has gained hold of a powerful belt allowing him to inverse gravity. Can you avoid the spikes and escape?

Jump by touching the left of the screen and invert gravity by pressing the right hand of the screen. The longer you survive, the higher your score.
